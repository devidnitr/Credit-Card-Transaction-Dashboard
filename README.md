 <h1>Insights</h1>

<h3>Customer Segmentation & Spending</h3>
<p>Clear spending patterns emerged across different customer groups. High-income and older customers tend to spend more on travel and lifestyle, while younger customers show higher usage in online shopping and food delivery categories.</p>

<h3>Delinquency Trends</h3>
<p>Delinquency was more common among younger customers with lower incomes, reflecting challenges in repayment capacity. Tracking these trends helps in designing better risk management strategies.</p>

<h3>Revenue Drivers</h3>
<p>Entertainment, travel, and lifestyle expenses contributed the highest share of revenue. Automated KPI reporting showed that a small set of high-value customers drove a disproportionate share of total revenue.</p>

<h3>Acquisition Costs vs. Satisfaction</h3>
<p>While acquisition costs were higher in premium segments, these customers also reported higher satisfaction scores and long-term retention, suggesting that the investment in premium customers yields better returns.</p>

<h3>Behavioral Insights</h3>
<p>Customers with higher transaction frequency (many small payments) tended to show better repayment discipline, whereas customers with fewer but larger purchases were more prone to delinquency.</p>
